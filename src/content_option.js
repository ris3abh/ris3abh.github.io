    aboutme2: " I have experience using tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Apache Spark to build models that can tackle complex problems. When I’m not tinkering with algorithms or poring over datasets, you can find me playing video games, binge watching animes, or trying out the latest tech gadgets. I’m always on the hunt for new ways to stay ahead of the curve, whether that means experimenting with new machine-learning models or trying out the latest programming language or something else entirely. Recently, I’ve been exploring the potential of deep learning to improve natural language processing and computer vision applications. I’ve also been experimenting with different approaches to handling big data, including distributed computing and cloud-based solutions.",
